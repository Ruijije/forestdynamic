The folder contains the input variables used to run the P model for estimating gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (Pn). The following variables are included:

tc – air temperature (°C)
patm – atmospheric pressure (Pa)
vpd – vapour pressure deficit (kPa)
fapar – fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation
ppfd – photosynthetic photon flux density (µmol m⁻² s⁻¹)
All data files are available on OneDrive at the following link:
https://imperiallondon-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/rd619_ic_ac_uk/Documents/Pmodel_data?csf=1&web=1&e=On9lbB
The P model code is openly available and documented at:
https://pyrealm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/pmodel/module_overview.html
The Tallo dataset used for model evaluation is also included at the same OneDrive link.

Additionally, the data and source code for the dynamic model can be found on GitHub
